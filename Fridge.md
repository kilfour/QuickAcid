# Memory PBT
1. Scoped override isolation
Property: overrides only affect the current execution
prop: For any key/value pair and two execution numbers,
only the intended execution sees the override.
2. Reset restores clean state
Property: after ResetRunScopedInputs(), all keys revert or disappear
3. Stashed values persist across runs
Property: stashing a value makes it available after new executions (unless explicitly cleared)
4. Reentrant swap is idempotent
Property: doing ScopedSwap(k,v) twice returns to the original state
5. Codegen reproducibility
Property: replaying the same memory produces the same run and spec outcome

Original Failing Run
  [input1 = 5, input2 = 42, input3 = -3]
         ↓
Execution Shrinking (remove steps)
  [input2 = 42]
         ↓
Input Shrinking (simplify values)
  [input2 = 0] ❌ still fails → minimal case found


| Unit Test                   | Property-Based Test (QuickAcid)         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Single input, known failure | Random + Shrink to find minimal input   |
| Written for one case        | Covers entire input space               |
| Example-based               | Invariant-based                         |
| High control, low discovery | Lower control, high discovery potential |

FAIL ──▶ Execution Shrinking ──▶ FAIL ──▶ Input Shrinking ──▶ ❌ Minimal Case



🧠 1. Start with the Why
People new to property-based testing often think finding a failing case is the end.
Your job: explain that shrinking is the real magic — it takes a messy failure and makes it diagnosable.

“Finding a bug is good.
Shrinking it to the simplest possible bug is what makes it usable.”

🪜 2. Describe the Two-Stage Process Clearly
QuickAcid shrinks in two main phases — be explicit about that:

Execution shrinking: removes entire steps from the test run

Input shrinking: simplifies individual inputs (numbers, strings, etc.)

You can show a before/after and point out how fewer steps + simpler data lead to better bug reports.

🧬 3. Mention Shrinkable vs Non-Shrinkable
Highlight that:

Input(...) introduces shrinkable values

Derived(...) and Stashed(...) do not shrink

Shrinking only applies to parts the framework has control over

Bonus: note how users can customize shrinking later.

🧪 4. Demonstrate with Real Failing Case
Use a compact version of something like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
from input in "input".Input(MGen.Int(1, 100))
from act in "act".Act(() => container.Value = input)
from spec in "spec".Spec(() => container.Value != 42)
...and show how QuickAcid hones in on input = 42 through shrinking.

🛑 5. Clarify When Shrinking Stops
Make it clear:

Shrinking stops when no simpler failing case exists

That’s why failing specs need to be deterministic — or else the shrinker gets confused

You can use .Verbose() to watch this process unfold

✍️ 6. Optional: Add Tips / Footnotes
You can gently mention:

Why flaky specs or side-effecty systems shrink poorly

How .Claim(...), .Where(...), and guards affect shrinking

That shrinking is what makes PBT superior to random fuzzers

What is QuickAcid?
QuickAcid is a property-based testing framework for C#.
It’s built around a simple idea: instead of writing examples of what your code should do,
you describe what must always be true, and let the framework try to break it.

It combines:

Declarative test construction via LINQ

Powerful fuzzing and shrinking via QuickMGenerate

Test lifecycle control through composable runners

Human-readable failure reports that shrink failures to their core

You don’t write lots of test cases.
You write invariants — and QuickAcid finds the test cases for you.
