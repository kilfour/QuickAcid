@"**Stashed(...)** creates a value once at the start of the test run and reuses it across all executions.  
This is typically where you'd stash your **system under test (SUT)** â€” a service, container, or domain object whose behavior you're exploring.  
Unlike `Input(...)`, stashed values are fixed for the entire run and never shrink, making them ideal for holding mutable state or orchestrating effects across inputs.
