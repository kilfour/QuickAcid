Ends the test run early once a specified condition is satisfied.
This combinator is not a property specification itself,
but a control structure that governs when a test run is considered 'proven' and can terminate before reaching the maximum number of executions. It's typically used in combination with `Stashed(...)` or other state-tracking steps that accumulate evidence across runs.
